# fileSync

What This Project Does --
  
  This code basically uses the 'dirsync' library found at https://pypi.org/project/dirsync/.
  It allows a user to sync folders with just a few lines of code. I use the code as a .bat file
  and it runs daily in the evening so that I can automate file saving at the end of a workday. I
  also added in a feature that sends out a text message to myself so that I know the program ran
  successfully. 
  

Why This Project Is Useful --
  
  This project is useful if you're trying to learn how to automate small tasks in the office,
  and if you want to learn how to send out a text message with python.
